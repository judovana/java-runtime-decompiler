.
	* Class Redefinition - hotswap - limits
		* No new methods, no new fields, no renamingâ€¦
		* Generally you can only change content of methods bodies (including new variables)

		* Take ages after JDK (jdk 17 not yet properly out, last udpate December 2022)
	* Jetbrains took it recently over
	* Jrebel JVMTI hacks
	* Tricks
		* In agent predefined map of objects to store fields/methods
		* Bytemen do it behind the doors

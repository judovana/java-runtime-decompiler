# How - Agent attach II
```
public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst); 
```
	* Is  the launched start point after agent is loaded, and instrumentation is what matters
	* For example you can open ServerSocket to receive commands
	* Agents can not be unloaded. Can be just turned off in best effort
	* And you can register transformer!
